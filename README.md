## General Info
This is my implementation of how to use swedish BankId system with a basic example.
I've included both how to authenticate an user and how we could add a signature for a pdf-file

The project is splited so frontend and backend consists of two different project. The frontend is written in React and you can find it here: [Frontend](https://github.com/patrik033/BankIdFront)




## Setup



#### Visual Studio:

To run the project you need an IDE, like Visual Studio Community: [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/)

#### Certificate:

To run this project you need a device that has a swedish bankid application installed for testing
It can be downloaded here: [BankId for test](https://www.bankid.com/utvecklare/test/skaffa-testbankid)
You cannot have both a production and test application installed on the same device.
